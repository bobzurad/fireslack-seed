My progress while working through Thinkster's [AngularFire Slack Tutorial](https://thinkster.io/angularfire-slack-tutorial)
Rather than use this repo, I suggest you follow their tutorial.

# angularfire-slack

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.11.1.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
